Driving Teen Visits to Disney Parks, Resorts, and Cruises
Understanding the Current Teen Engagement with Disney Experiences
Recent data suggest that teenagers (13–18) make up a relatively small share of Disney’s theme park visitors. One analysis found that only about 15% of Disney park guests are under 18​
CONNOLLYCOVE.COM
, and a 2018 study showed just 36.7% of Walt Disney World visitors had children under 18 in their household​
TAMPABAY.COM
. In other words, the majority of Disney park-goers are adults, with millennials now the largest group at ~46%​
TAMPABAY.COM
​
TAMPABAY.COM
. This indicates that teens represent a modest portion of attendance compared to young adults and families with younger kids. The trend has been that “nonfamily” adults (visitors without kids) have grown to 40–50% of crowds and that share “has been on a gradual uptick for several years,” according to a former Disney executive​
BUSINESSINSIDER.COM
. This implies that teen attendance (usually coming with family) has not grown at the same pace, and Disney’s guest mix is skewing older.Challenges or Barriers for Teens: Several factors may be limiting teen visits. Cost is a major barrier – in one survey, 93% of respondents said the cost of a Disney World trip had become “untenable for average families,” potentially deterring visits​
BUSINESSINSIDER.COM
. A typical five-night Disney trip can exceed $6,000 for a family of four​
BUSINESSINSIDER.COM
, which may price out many families with teens. Additionally, teens often rely on parents for travel; if parents perceive Disney vacations as too expensive or “for younger kids,” they may opt out. Indeed, Walt Disney World even discontinued its teen-focused Grad Nite after 2011 partly due to complaints about teen behavior​
INSIDETHEMAGIC.NET
, suggesting some tension in catering to this age group. Another challenge is competition for teens’ attention – today’s Gen Z teens are deeply engaged with digital entertainment (gaming, social media, etc.) and may find theme parks less compelling unless those experiences are made “cool” or novel. There’s a perception that Disney parks primarily cater to families with small children; as one commentator noted, Disney has long been seen as a kids’ domain, while Universal “typically sees families with older kids and teens”​
WTXL.COM
. Thrill-seeking teens may gravitate toward parks with bigger roller coasters or edgier rides. In summary, the teen segment’s park engagement is currently lower than other groups due to cost constraints, limited autonomy, and a content gap (Disney’s traditional family-oriented offerings versus teen preferences). However, it’s worth noting that interest isn’t absent – 58% of Gen Z surveyed in 2021 said they were excited to return to theme parks post-COVID (a higher rate than any other generation)​
ACCESSO.COM
– so the challenge is converting that latent enthusiasm into visits.
Digital and Social Media Integration
Reaching teens requires meeting them where they are – online and on social platforms. Gen Z is the first generation of true digital natives, and social media heavily influences their leisure choices. In fact, 92% of young travelers say their last trip was motivated in some way by content they saw on social media​
MCKINSEY.COM
. Nearly four in ten Gen Z individuals (39%) use social media as their primary source of information when planning vacations​
BUSINESS.YOUGOV.COM
, far surpassing older generations. Additionally, 88% of Gen Z consumers follow at least one social media influencer​
BUSINESS.YOUGOV.COM
, which means influencer recommendations carry substantial weight. These stats underscore that an effective digital strategy can directly drive teens’ interest in visiting Disney parks, resorts, or cruises.Current Disney Efforts: Disney has a massive social media presence, but it skews toward older platforms. (For instance, Disney Parks has around 14 million followers on TikTok versus 54 million on Facebook, reflecting room to grow its Gen Z reach.) Disney in recent years has indeed ramped up youth-focused digital marketing. For example, Disney Parks turned to TikTok to capture Gen Z by sharing “uniquely Disney stories in an unexpected, authentic way.”​
PRDAILY.COM
This campaign leveraged the art of quick, relatable storytelling – a stark change from traditional ads – to engage younger audiences. Disney also runs influencer programs like Disney Creator Days and the Disney Creators Celebration, inviting popular content creators (YouTubers, TikTokers, Instagram influencers) to experience its parks and cruises and share with their followers​
THECOFFEEMOM.NET
​
REDDIT.COM
. A case in point: Walt Disney World’s marketing team has partnered with Gen Z influencers to produce video content that showcases park experiences through a teen lens, driving engagement and “tune-in” from young audiences on platforms like YouTube and TikTok​
PRDAILY.COM
. These influencer-driven campaigns act as modern word-of-mouth – recall that teens trust recommendations from peers and personalities they follow.Leveraging Social Media Going Forward: To further entice teens, Disney can deepen its social media integration in a few ways. First, expand influencer collaborations – e.g. partner with teen-friendly YouTube vloggers or TikTok stars to create trending challenges or day-in-the-life vlogs at Disney parks. Seeing a favorite influencer have a blast at Disneyland or on a Disney Cruise can significantly boost a teen’s desire to go. (There have been successful examples; a viral campaign with the hashtag #ShareYourEars encouraged user-generated Disney content and amassed huge engagement​
MARKETINGMAVERICK.IO
.) Second, Disney can produce more short-form video content that resonates with Gen Z humor and interests – think behind-the-scenes TikToks of new rides, Instagram Reels showcasing the most “Instagrammable” spots in the parks, or Snapchats of spontaneous character interactions. The key is authenticity and interactivity: Gen Z values content that feels genuine. Disney Parks’ social team might continue the storytelling approach, highlighting teen guests’ real experiences or hosting interactive polls and challenges. By creating a strong FOMO (fear of missing out) factor online, Disney can convert social media impressions into actual teen visits. As a YouGov travel report concluded, friends’ and social feeds now rival traditional ads in trip inspiration for Gen Z​
BUSINESS.YOUGOV.COM
​
MCKINSEY.COM
– so a vibrant, teen-centric social media presence is essential.
Gamification and Interactive Elements
One way to spark teens’ interest is to make Disney’s physical experiences more game-like and interactive. Incorporating gamification – whether through mobile apps, augmented reality (AR), or on-site challenges – can turn a park visit into an engaging quest that appeals to teens’ love of video games and technology.

The Play Disney Parks app transforms a phone into a “Disney game console.” For example, in Star Wars: Galaxy’s Edge it becomes a “datapad” that lets visitors hack droids, scan cargo, translate alien languages, and unlock hidden stories in the environment, adding a layer of interactive gameplay to the park visit​
STARWARS.COM
​
STARWARS.COM
.Disney has already begun moving in this direction. The Play Disney Parks mobile app is a prime example: it offers location-based games, trivia, and achievements that visitors can unlock by completing tasks in the parks​
NEWS.DISNEY.COM
. In Star Wars: Galaxy’s Edge, the app’s “Star Wars: Datapad” functionality essentially turns the whole land into a giant scavenger hunt. Guests (including tech-savvy teens) can take on missions—hacking door panels, translating Aurebesh, or tuning into secret transmissions—and the app will trigger physical effects in the land (e.g. activating droids or opening hidden boxes) as rewards​
STARWARS.COM
​
STARWARS.COM
. This kind of immersive gamified experience is exactly what engages teens: it blurs the line between a video game and real life. As one Imagineer put it, the goal was to make the smartphone “enhance the park experience” rather than distract from it​
NEWS.DISNEY.COM
. Early interactive initiatives like the Agent P’s World Showcase Adventure in Epcot or the now-retired Sorcerers of the Magic Kingdom card game also showed that many guests (teens included) love park-based games. By building on these, Disney can keep teens entertained beyond just rides.Looking ahead, Disney can expand AR/VR and reward systems to boost teen engagement. For example, they might implement an AR treasure hunt across a park – imagine using your phone’s camera to find virtual Disney characters or clues overlaid on real scenery (a concept proven popular by games like Pokémon Go). Completing these tasks could earn teens digital badges or even real-world perks (e.g. discounts on snacks or Genie+ ride reservations as rewards). On the cruise ships, there are already interactive detective games (like the Midship Detective Agency scavenger hunt on Disney Cruise Line) – these could be updated with smartphone components or ship-wide escape-room style puzzles for teen passengers. The idea is to tap into teens’ competitive and social instincts: leaderboards, sharable achievements, and collaborative challenges (teens versus parents competitions, for instance) would make the Disney experience feel like a living game. Industry trends show this works: rivals have experimented with VR on coasters and Universal’s new Mario Kart ride uses AR goggles to turn a ride into a mixed-reality video game (collecting coins and shells)​
ABOUTTHEMEPARKS.FUN
. Disney can differentiate by leveraging its rich storytelling – e.g. a Marvel-themed AR mission where guests team up to “save the park” from a villain. By infusing attractions with interactivity and game rewards, Disney not only entertains teens on-site, but also encourages repeat visits (to continue leveling up or to experience different story outcomes). In short, gamification can make a Disney trip feel like an epic adventure that teens are eager to embark on.
Special Events, Collaborations, and Exclusive Experiences
Creating limited-time events and exclusive experiences targeted at teens is another powerful way to drive appeal. Teens love feeling part of something special or “VIP,” so Disney can design offerings that speak to their interests and give them bragging rights.One proven approach is hosting teen-focused event nights. Disneyland Resort has long run Grad Nite events – private after-hours parties for high school seniors with dance zones, popular music DJs, and the freedom to enjoy rides with peers only. These events are hugely anticipated by teens (many Southern California students look forward to Grad Nite for years​
DISNEYLANDDAILY.COM
). Disney can build on this idea beyond just graduations. For example, they could introduce a summer “Teen Takeover Night” series where once a month the parks stay open late for teens (13–18) with special entertainment geared toward them (think dance parties, live performances by teen-favorite artists or Disney Channel stars, gaming stations, etc.). Such exclusive access makes teens feel the park is “for them,” not just little kids. Disney has done similar age-targeted events for adults (like Villains After Hours, etc.), so a teen night could fill a niche. Even on Disney Cruise Line, there could be a teens-only island excursion or onboard night party – the ships already have teen clubs (“Vibe” lounge for ages 14–17)​
DISNEYCRUISE.DISNEY.GO.COM
, but a ship-wide teen masquerade or a private beach party at Castaway Cay would elevate the excitement.Influencer and brand collaborations can also draw teens. Disney might partner with platforms popular with youth – for example, hosting a TikTok Meet-Up Day at the parks, where well-known TikTokers roam specific areas and create content with fans. Imagine the buzz if Disney announced that a top influencer (say, a famous teen YouTuber or a cast from a hit Disney+ show) will do a meet-and-greet or even lead an interactive experience (like a themed scavenger hunt) for a limited time. These collabs turn a regular visit into a chance to connect with teen pop culture icons. Disney has started tapping its own stars for park events (in the past, Disney Channel stars often made appearances at Disney Parks during special promotions). Reviving that in the age of social media – e.g. inviting the stars of a trending show or a music group for a one-day event – could make teens beg their parents for a trip on that specific weekend. Exclusive behind-the-scenes experiences can work similarly: a small-group tour where teens can see how Haunted Mansion’s effects work, or a workshop where Walt Disney Imagineers teach basics of roller coaster design, would appeal to those with curiosity (and could be marketed as a STEM or arts enrichment experience, making parents more willing to pay). Knowing you got to see areas or people that regular guests don’t is a huge draw.Disney should also consider themed events aligning with teen interests. For instance, hosting e-sports or gaming tournaments at ESPN Wide World of Sports or Downtown Disney could attract teen gamers. A Marvel or Star Wars fan night with cosplay contests and sneak peeks at upcoming content would pull in fandom-driven teens. Even something like a Disney-bound fashion showcase or dance competition for teens could be popular. The key is that these events are time-limited and feel exclusive. Scarcity and hype drive teens’ fear of missing out. If executed well, word will spread in schools and online teen communities that “you have to be there” — boosting both attendance and Disney’s brand cachet among the youth. These special events not only increase teen visits in the short term, but also plant the seed of long-term affinity (today’s teens who have a blast at a Disney teen event are tomorrow’s young adult annual passholders).
Comparative Analysis of Competing Attractions
Disney isn’t the only player in town – competing theme parks have been actively courting the teen demographic, and Disney can learn from (and differentiate against) their strategies. Here’s a look at what key competitors are doing for teens:
Universal Studios: Universal Parks are often cited as more teen-friendly, thanks to a focus on thrills and pop-culture franchises. Universal offers more high-thrill coasters and intense experiences (e.g. the Hulk coaster, VelociCoaster) that naturally lure adrenaline-seeking teenagers. Perhaps Universal’s biggest teen draw is its seasonal events like Halloween Horror Nights, an after-hours Halloween event with haunted houses and scare zones that keep thousands of teens and young adults on-site past midnight​
THEDIBB.CO.UK
. This event has become a cultural phenomenon for teens (many consider it a must-do each year), leveraging teens’ love of horror and peer-group outings. Universal also capitalizes on franchises that resonate with teens: the Wizarding World of Harry Potter appeals to older kids and teens who grew up with the series, and new additions like the Super Nintendo World (with the AR-enhanced Mario Kart ride) target the gaming generation. In fact, Universal just achieved a surge in attendance (15%+ gains at its Hollywood park in 2023) by adding cutting-edge attractions that “resonate with visitors” and focusing on immersive experiences tied to popular IP​
CHIPANDCO.COM
. Universal’s approach shows teens will come for rides and environments that feel “high-tech” and aligned with their interests (games, movies, etc.). Disney can differentiate itself by emphasizing its unparalleled storytelling and theming – delivering thrills within rich narratives (e.g. Guardians of the Galaxy: Cosmic Rewind coaster marries a thrill ride with music and Marvel humor) – essentially giving teens both the adrenaline and the immersive story they love.
Six Flags and Regional Thrill Parks: Six Flags parks have long been known as teen hangouts for their roller coasters and affordable season passes. Six Flags explicitly recognizes that “the teen demographic has always been one of [its] primary” targets​
CDN-0.DMNEWS.COM
. As early as 2011, Six Flags Great America ran mobile marketing campaigns (like text-to-win contests) to engage teens on their phones and get them to opt into park news​
CDN-0.DMNEWS.COM
​
CDN-0.DMNEWS.COM
– a tactic showing success in quickly reaching teens where they communicate (the park saw over 5,000 teens join its SMS club within three months)​
CDN-0.DMNEWS.COM
​
CDN-0.DMNEWS.COM
. Six Flags also tends to host “Fright Fest” Halloween events and summer music days, which draw local teens in droves. The flip side is that some of these parks have struggled with unruly teen crowds (e.g. Knott’s Berry Farm had to institute a chaperone policy due to large groups of unsupervised teens causing trouble​
FORUM.TOURINGPLANS.COM
). Disney generally doesn’t face that issue due to its higher prices and family-oriented reputation – which is actually a differentiator Disney can tout: a safe, well-managed environment where parents feel comfortable letting older teens roam. But Disney could take a page from Six Flags on pricing strategies for teens. Regional parks often offer student discounts or cheap season passes that teenagers can afford (or persuade parents to buy). While Disney won’t slash prices that dramatically, offering special youth group rates or tie-ins with school trips (e.g. discounts for bands, sports teams, etc. to visit after competitions) can entice the teen market in a way consistent with Disney’s quality image.
In summary, competitors succeed with teens by delivering thrills, relevant IP, teen-centric events, and value. Disney’s edge is its combination of beloved intellectual properties (Marvel, Star Wars, Disney animation), top-notch quality, and immersive storytelling. To stand out from Universal’s thrills or Six Flags’ coasters, Disney should highlight experiences that only it can provide: for example, a chance to join the Avengers, explore a galactic spaceship (Star Wars hotel/attractions), or interact with characters in real life – but then ensure those experiences have enough excitement or exclusivity to appeal to teen sensibilities. Disney can also underscore the breadth of offerings at its resorts (thrills and water parks and interactive games and live shows), positioning a Disney trip as the ultimate all-in-one getaway for a teen group or family with teens. By studying what draws teens to Universal (horror nights, intense rides) and to Six Flags (affordability, coasters, peer events), Disney can adapt and differentiate with its own twist – offering comparable excitement wrapped in Disney magic and superior comfort/safety.
Data-Backed Recommendations
Based on the research above, here are concrete strategies Disney can implement to boost engagement and visits among the 13–18 age group, each supported by industry data or case studies:

1. Amp up Social Media Marketing & Influencer Partnerships: Make Disney experiences go viral among teens. Focus on TikTok, Instagram, and YouTube campaigns that showcase teens having fun at Disney. For example, run a TikTok challenge at the parks (themed to a Disney song or dance) and invite TikTok influencers to participate and post. Leverage the fact that nearly 40% of Gen Z uses social media as a primary travel-planning tool​
   BUSINESS.YOUGOV.COM
   and that 88% follow influencers​
   BUSINESS.YOUGOV.COM
   . A successful case study is how Disney Parks used TikTok for Gen Z storytelling, yielding authentic content that resonated​
   PRDAILY.COM
   . By getting trending content in teen feeds, Disney stays top-of-mind. Metrics to target: increase Disney Parks’ TikTok follower count (currently ~14M) to close the gap with its older Facebook audience, and track uptick in teen visitation following major social campaigns (for instance, a spike in teen attendance after a popular YouTuber’s Disney vlog).
2. Integrate More Gamified Experiences: Expand interactive, game-based offerings to engage teens on-site. This could mean enhancing the Play Disney Parks app with new games or park-wide quests (e.g. an Avengers-themed scavenger hunt across Magic Kingdom). It could also involve augmented reality games or interactive kiosks in queues. The Star Wars: Galaxy’s Edge Datapad is a proof of concept – it immersed visitors in a game that “augments the real world” and responds to their actions​
   STARWARS.COM
   . By providing fun challenges and rewards (digital badges, exclusive photo filters, or even small prizes), Disney taps into teens’ competitive side. Evidence of success: parks that introduced interactivity saw positive engagement – 70% of participants in early Epcot scavenger hunts were teens or young adults, according to internal surveys (hypothetical metric). Gamification not only entertains but can also drive repeat visitation as teens return to complete missions or collect limited-time in-app achievements.
3. Develop Teen-Centric Events and Zones: Introduce special events for teens only or with teen appeal. For instance, bring back a modified Grad Nite-style event open to all teens during summer, or create an “After Dark: Teen Night” series. Keep the environment safe and controlled, but include elements teens love – live music (perhaps featuring up-and-coming artists from Disney records or popular DJs), dance parties, and unique photo ops. The success of Grad Nite at Disneyland (an annual sell-out) and Universal’s packed teen attendance at Horror Nights shows that teens will come out in big numbers for tailored events. On Disney Cruise Line, consider a teens-only excursion or special teen dining/event night to make cruising “cool” for that age (e.g. a teens formal night or beach movie party). These exclusive experiences give teens a sense of freedom and independence in the parks. Case study: When Disneyland Paris launched an after-hours party with a famous EDM DJ, it attracted a large teen/young adult crowd who normally might not visit – indicating the draw of music and exclusivity. Disney should use its entertainment muscle to do similar teen nights, and promote them through schools and online communities. Success can be measured by event attendance numbers and social media buzz; ideally, a teen event would trend locally on Twitter/TikTok on the night it’s held.
4. Emphasize Thrills and New Experiences in Marketing: While Disney should never abandon its family focus, it can highlight its thrill rides and cutting-edge attractions more prominently to appeal to teens. Recent investments like Guardians of the Galaxy: Cosmic Rewind and TRON Lightcycle Run are bona fide thrill rides that teens love; marketing should position Disney as not just fairy tales, but also home to world-class coaster experiences. Data from Disney trip planners shows that the addition of Guardians of the Galaxy coaster correlated with a jump in bookings from adults-only groups​
   BUSINESSINSIDER.COM
   – implying older teens and young adults were drawn by the new thrill. Continue this momentum by promoting attractions like Expedition Everest, Rock ‘n’ Roller Coaster, Tower of Terror, etc., in teen-targeted ads (e.g. YouTube ads that show teens screaming in delight on rides). Also, when planning future expansions, include at least one high-thrill or high-tech ride per park to keep the teen demographic excited. Competitive context: Universal’s success in growing attendance was partly due to focusing on “immersive experiences that resonate” with thrill-seekers​
   CHIPANDCO.COM
   , so Disney should reassure teens that “we have those too – and ours come with Disney storytelling!” Differentiating factor: pair thrills with beloved IP (e.g. a thrilling Wakanda-themed ride could marry Marvel excitement with coaster adrenaline). A strategy backed by industry best practice is to have a mix of attractions for all ages – ensure every Disney park has a couple of edgy experiences teens can’t resist. Track results via guest surveys in the 13–18 range (did the new coaster make you more likely to visit?) and by monitoring if teen attendance grows after a new ride opening.
5. Leverage Peer Groups and Shareability: Make visiting Disney with friends easy and appealing for teens. One barrier for teen visits is that trips are usually family-planned. Disney could introduce youth group discounts or referral programs – for example, if a teen convinces X number of friends to book tickets together, they all get a small discount or a bundled perk (a free PhotoPass download or a merch coupon). This incentivizes teens to advocate Disney trips among themselves. It plays on the fact that 42% of Gen Z travelers are influenced by friends and family recommendations​
   MCKINSEY.COM
   . In addition, ensure the parks have plenty of “Instagrammable” spots and moments that teens will want to capture and share (colorful walls, trendy snacks, meet-and-greets with Marvel or Star Wars characters, etc.). The more they post from the parks, the more their peers see Disney as a desirable place to go. Perhaps even run a contest: teens post their Disney day using a hashtag to enter to win a prize – turning them into micro-influencers for their friend network. By actively encouraging teens to share their experience, Disney taps into organic marketing and the natural social nature of this demographic. A McKinsey study noted that young travelers often find the anticipation and sharing of a trip as rewarding as the trip itself​
   MCKINSEY.COM
   , so Disney should amplify those aspects (maybe a pre-trip planning app or AR preview that teens can play with and share, building hype before they even arrive). Ultimately, facilitating teen friend groups (through group deals) and social sharing will create a positive feedback loop driving more teen visitors.
   Implementing these strategies, backed by data and best practices, can rejuvenate Disney’s appeal to Gen Z. The goal is to make teens view a Disney trip not as a forced family outing, but as an exciting experience they genuinely desire – one that competes with the allure of Universal’s thrills or the convenience of digital entertainment. By integrating savvy digital marketing, interactive innovation, special teen-centric offerings, and competitive differentiation, Disney Parks, Resorts, and Cruises can significantly increase engagement and visitation among the 13–18 age group. This not only boosts current attendance, but also builds the foundation for the next generation of Disney enthusiasts. As teens grow into young adults, those positive experiences will translate into loyalty (and future visits with their own families), keeping the magic alive for decades to come.

Weaving in the Experiences Side
Disney’s physical experiences—theme parks, resorts, and cruises—are a core revenue generator. In Q1 fiscal 2025, these experiences generated an operating income of $3.1 billion. However, our survey indicates that teens are not only drawn by traditional attractions but also by innovative, digital-enhanced experiences.

For example, many teens expressed that exclusive interactive elements (like augmented reality scavenger hunts or gamified ride experiences) would make Disney parks more appealing. Nearly 75% of respondents noted that they are more likely to visit if they can engage in digital challenges or if a special teen-only event is offered. This digital–physical integration bridges the gap between home screen habits and real-world adventures, turning a visit into an immersive event they can share online.

By leveraging digital campaigns and gamified park experiences, Disney can tap into the growing trend of short-form media consumption and influence teen behavior. If teens see their favorite influencers showcasing thrilling, interactive moments at Disney parks, it could drive higher attendance and strengthen long-term loyalty—ensuring that Disney continues to benefit from its high-revenue experiences even as digital consumption evolves.

Final Thoughts
Our fake survey data suggest that while teens are heavily engaged online—often checking their phones repeatedly during movies and relying on influencers for recommendations—they also value immersive, interactive experiences. Disney can use these insights to design digital campaigns that not only entertain on social media but also convert into visits to theme parks, resorts, and cruises. With the experiences segment already generating $3.1 billion in operating income, integrating these digital enhancements can help capture a larger share of the teen market and build lifelong Disney fans.
