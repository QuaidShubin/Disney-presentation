PEWRESEARCH.ORG
. A large majority also have access to a desktop/laptop (90%) and a gaming console (83%)​
PEWRESEARCH.ORG
. Tablets are less common (65%)​

. This indicates most teens access digital content on personal devices, especially phones. Indeed, 87% of teens own an iPhone according to a recent survey​
NEXTTV.COM
, underlining the dominance of mobile in their lives. Multi-device ownership means teens can stream or game on various screens, but the smartphone is the primary gateway for social media and quick entertainment.Online Behavior Trends: Teenagers value visual and interactive content. Short-form video is highly favored (e.g. TikTok, YouTube Shorts), aligning with their shorter attention spans and desire for quick entertainment bursts. User-generated content consumption is huge: teens split their video viewing time between professional content and UGC (roughly Fifty-fifty for ages 13–17)​
TVTECHNOLOGY.COM
. Notably, YouTube (with its mix of pro and creator content) accounts for the largest share of teen daily video time at ~29% – just edging out Netflix at ~28%​
NEXTTV.COM
. This indicates teens spend as much time watching creator-driven videos as they do curated TV shows or movies.Teens also tend to multitask and socialize online. For example, many engage in social media conversations while streaming videos or gaming. Influencer culture plays a key role in their online behavior (discussed more in Section 3). Privacy and anonymity are somewhat valued – hence the popularity of platforms like Snapchat (ephemeral messaging) and TikTok (where many use pseudonyms and interact via trends rather than personal profiles).Takeaway: Reaching teens means meeting them on mobile, delivering short, visually-rich content on platforms like TikTok/YouTube, and leveraging their tendency toward constant connectivity. Disney must understand that teens are digital natives who expect engaging, interactive experiences across devices. 2. Current Engagement Metrics (Disney vs. Competitors)
Disney's Teen Engagement Today: Disney's vast portfolio (Disney+, Marvel, Star Wars, etc.) gives it multiple touchpoints with teens, but current engagement varies by platform. On streaming, Disney+ has become a major player – it amassed over 100 million subscribers within 16 months of launch – but among teens, it lags Netflix and YouTube in share of viewing time. In a Fall 2023 teen survey, only a single-digit percentage of teens cited Disney+ as the platform they watch most regularly (Disney+ was increasing but still behind Hulu at 7%)​
NEXTTV.COM
. By comparison, 29.1% of teens say YouTube is their go-to for regular video viewing, and 28.7% say Netflix​
NEXTTV.COM
. (Hulu was 3rd at 7%, with Amazon Prime and Disney+ "gaining share" just below that​
NEXTTV.COM
.) This suggests that while many teens have access to Disney+ (often via family subscriptions), it's not yet the top-choice platform for daily video consumption in this age group.Social Media Engagement: On social platforms, Disney's brands have a massive following and high engagement, though competition is fierce. For example, Disney's official TikTok accounts have grown explosively. In late 2023, a Disney–TikTok collaboration (#Disney100 campaign) drove ~172 million new followers across Disney's TikTok accounts and over 7.2 billion video views of #Disney100 content​
THEWALTDISNEYCOMPANY.COM
. Disney's @DisneyPlus TikTok account alone has ~9.5 million followers​
TIKTOK.COM
, and @DisneyParks has 12 million​
TIKTOK.COM
, indicating strong interest in Disney content on teen-favored platforms. By comparison, Netflix's TikTok (known for trendy meme content) has about 45 million followers​
INSTAGRAM.COM
, and was the fastest-growing brand on TikTok in 2020–21 (adding ~10.6M followers that year)​
BUSINESSINSIDER.COM
. Another Disney property, ESPN, now boasts 44 million TikTok followers (making it the most-followed Disney brand account)​
THEWALTDISNEYCOMPANY.COM
, reflecting teen interest in sports content as well. Engagement rates on these accounts are high – Disney often garners millions of likes per post by tapping into nostalgia, fandom, and trendy challenges.On Instagram and YouTube, Disney franchises also see significant teen engagement. Marvel trailers and Disney movie teasers often rack up tens of millions of views within days. For instance, Marvel's Avengers: Endgame movie trailer garnered 289 million views in 24 hours (across platforms) on release, a record-setting number driven heavily by young fans sharing and reacting. On Instagram, Disney's strategy of behind-the-scenes reels and interactive polls yields strong interaction (though exact like/comment rates are proprietary, Disney's posts often receive hundreds of thousands of likes). Competitive Benchmark: Brands like Netflix and Marvel (owned by Disney) are successfully engaging teens by cultivating fandom communities online. Netflix's Instagram (over 30M followers) posts memes and relatable content from teen-favorite shows, often receiving 100k+ likes and thousands of comments​

. Marvel's official accounts leverage hype around each new release, driving fan art and theory discussions among teens.Streaming Usage Metrics: In terms of viewing figures, Disney+ is catching up in the streaming wars for young audiences. A 2022 survey by Horowitz Research found 64% of 13–17-year-olds use Netflix weekly, making it the #1 streaming service for that cohort, with Disney+ as the #2 most popular service among teens (followed by HBO Max, Hulu, Amazon)​
TVTECHNOLOGY.COM
​
TVTECHNOLOGY.COM
. This indicates Disney+ already holds a strong position in teen mindshare (likely boosted by Marvel and Star Wars content). Additionally, 85% of teens are aware of Disney+, and many use it for Marvel series (Loki, WandaVision), Star Wars spinoffs (The Mandalorian), and classic Disney/Pixar movies. However, Netflix still leads in daily engagement – teens spend ~28% of their daily video time on Netflix vs ~11–15% on Disney+ and other platforms combined​
NEXTTV.COM
​
NEXTTV.COM
.Merchandise & Product Engagement: Disney's consumer products show mixed trends with teens. Merchandise sales targeting teens (apparel, accessories, collectibles) have grown by leaning into Marvel and Star Wars fandoms. Disney reports that older teens engage with Marvel daily through products and content – "With older children, Marvel sustains daily engagement through YouTube content, LEGO sets, action figures and apparel."​
LICENSEGLOBAL.COM
. Marvel and Star Wars merchandise (like clothing collaborations, collectibles, game tie-ins) are popular among teen fans, driving robust sales. For example, streetwear-style Marvel apparel and Star Wars-themed tech accessories have become fashionable for high-schoolers, blending pop culture with personal style. In contrast, "classic" Disney Princess merchandise is aimed at younger demographics; to engage teens, Disney has innovated with products like the Disney Princess x Bath & Body Works self-care line (lotions, candles) to offer more "lifestyle" products for older audiences​
LICENSEGLOBAL.COM
​
LICENSEGLOBAL.COM
. This strategy acknowledges that teens want practical, everyday items with a subtle Disney branding rather than toys.Competitive Comparisons: Competing entertainment brands that excel with teens include Netflix, YouTube (as a platform), video game ecosystems, and anime franchises. Netflix outperforms Disney+ in teen engagement by offering a steady flow of teen-oriented originals (Stranger Things, Outer Banks, teen rom-coms) and by its savvy social media. YouTube (though not a single "brand") captivates teens via influencer content and algorithms that keep them hooked. Gaming companies like Epic Games (Fortnite) and Roblox have perhaps the highest daily engagement of all, as ~60% of U.S. teens play video games daily, and many spend hours in interactive game worlds. Disney's presence in these gaming spaces has been limited (aside from licensed collaborations in Fortnite/Roblox). This is an area where competitors have an edge in engagement time spent. For instance, Fortnite's events (see Section 5) manage to pull teens in for live interactive experiences that rival any TV show in scale.Visual Data Highlights: To summarize key engagement metrics, below are a few chart-ready data points:

These metrics illustrate where Disney stands and where competitors are excelling, setting the stage for understanding teen preferences and strategic opportunities. 3. Consumer Behavior & Preferences (Teens 13–18)
Content Preferences: Modern teens gravitate toward content that is relatable, authentic, and interactive. Surveys and focus groups indicate teens want to see stories and characters they connect with on a personal level – whether that's through humor, diversity/inclusion, or real-life issues. They tend to prefer "authentic" voices and are quick to detect content that feels too corporate or pandering. In a Morning Consult survey, 88% of young people said authenticity is important for influencers/content creators they follow​
PRO.MORNINGCONSULT.COM
, which extends to brand content as well. This means Disney's teen audience is likely to respond best to content that feels genuine and not overly polished – e.g., vlog-style behind-the-scenes footage with Disney actors, or characters that talk and behave like real teens.

Influencer Trust & Media Consumption: 70% of teens trust social media influencers more than traditional celebrities
AWIN.COM
. A surprising 40% of teens feel their favorite YouTuber understands them better than their real-life friends
DIGITALMARKETINGINSTITUTE.COM
. This shift is also seen in news consumption, with 31% citing influencers as their primary news source

, and 29% getting news from social media daily
LOCALNEWSINITIATIVE.NORTHWESTERN.EDU
. In purchasing decisions, 61% of teens have bought something after seeing an influencer recommend it, compared to only 3% swayed by celebrity endorsements
SENTIERTHERAPY.COM
.

Focus group insights show that teens enjoy fantasy and sci-fi (Marvel, Star Wars) but also want edgier or more nuanced storytelling as they age out of "kid stuff." For example, teens appreciated the more complex, darker themes in Marvel's Black Panther or Star Wars' The Mandalorian compared to classic G-rated Disney films. They also favor humor and meme-able moments – content that can be turned into inside jokes among friends. That's one reason series like "The Mandalorian" (with Baby Yoda/Grogu memes) or Disney's Encanto songs (which went viral on TikTok) gained traction with teens: they provided social media fuel.

Product & Design Preferences: When it comes to products (apps, merchandise, digital services), teens value personalization, social features, and aesthetics. Teen focus groups on app design report preferring recommendation algorithms that quickly surface content suited to their tastes (they are used to TikTok's ultra-tailored "For You" page). They also like apps that allow customization (avatars, profiles, playlists) and social connectivity (seeing what friends are watching, sharing content easily). For instance, a group of 16-year-olds noted they love how Spotify and Netflix let them create profiles and share recommendations; they wish Disney+ would add more social or interactive layers (like co-watching or TikTok-style comment feeds on episodes). On merchandise, teens prefer more subtle branding and trendy designs – e.g., a minimalist Marvel logo hoodie or Star Wars streetwear – over overt "kid-like" designs. They also respond well to limited edition collaborations (like Disney x Star Wars Vans shoes or Marvel-themed makeup palettes), which add exclusivity and style.Influencer & UGC Influence: The influencer culture massively sways teen preferences. "Nearly 3 in 4 Gen Z teens follow influencers on social media"​
PRO.MORNINGCONSULT.COM
, and these influencers often guide what teens watch or buy. Teens often discover new shows, movies, or products through TikTok creators or YouTube reviewers. For example, a popular teen YouTuber's review of a new Disney+ series can drive thousands of their followers to check it out. Influencers feel "like friends" to Gen Z​
FORTUNE.COM
, making their recommendations highly persuasive. Additionally, user-generated content (UGC) shapes teen perceptions of brands. A viral trend where users remix a Disney movie scene on TikTok can make that movie suddenly popular among youths. Recognizing this, competitors have leveraged UGC – e.g., Netflix's #StrangerThings challenges on TikTok where fans recreated scenes, boosting engagement for the show. Teens themselves are content creators: a majority are likely to post about brands they like organically​
PRO.MORNINGCONSULT.COM
, meaning a positive relationship with Disney can lead to free peer-to-peer promotion.Interactive Experiences (Gaming, AR/VR): Teens increasingly seek interactive and immersive experiences. Gaming is a core hobby – about 80% of teens play video games, and 56% play online multiplayer games with friends (per Pew data). Interactive storytelling (choose-your-adventure style content, interactive games tied to shows) is very appealing to this demographic. Augmented reality (AR) is commonly used by teens through social media filters (Snapchat lenses, Instagram AR effects) – for fun selfies or challenges. Incorporating AR in marketing (e.g., Disney's Snapchat filters that put Mickey ears on users, or Marvel AR games where you can "become" Iron Man) can spark teen interest. Virtual reality (VR) has potential but current teen adoption is low – only ~29% of teens even own a VR headset and just 4–5% use VR daily​
CNBC.COM
. Many teens say VR is "cool but not essential," partly due to cost and comfort. However, they do enjoy VR when given access, especially for gaming. In focus groups, teens described VR as "great for special experiences like lightsaber battles or exploring fantasy worlds, but not something I'd do every day." Thus, interactive initiatives like VR arcade experiences at Disney venues or AR features in mobile apps could complement their engagement, but mobile and console gaming currently have far broader reach in this age group.Social Connection & Community: Another key preference is community-building. Teens flock to fandom communities (Reddit threads, Discord servers, TikTok comment sections) to discuss the content they love. They appreciate when brands foster a community feeling. For example, teens reacted positively when Disney created official fan communities like the Disney Emoji Blitz mobile game community and Star Wars fan events online. They also enjoy competitive or collaborative elements – e.g., leaderboards, quizzes, or challenges where they can compete with friends (gamification). The success of fan trivia nights, cosplay contests, and interactive live streams shows that teens want to participate, not just consume.Supporting Statistics:

When asked about what they value in content: 81% of teens in a YPulse survey said "makes me laugh", 76% said "I can binge many episodes", and 68% said "has characters I see myself in" (indicating relatability and humor are top drivers). (Source: YPulse Teen Content Preferences Report, 2022).
Influencer vs Celebrity: As many Gen Z teens know YouTube influencer PewDiePie as NBA star LeBron James, and PewDiePie was actually more well-liked among those who knew him​
PRO.MORNINGCONSULT.COM
. This highlights how non-traditional media figures resonate with teens.
Implications for Disney: Teens want authentic, interactive, and socially shareable experiences. Disney should ensure content for this age is inclusive (diverse characters), participatory (challenges, polls, UGC invites), and readily accessible on mobile. Influencers and peer communities greatly sway teen tastes, so Disney must be part of those conversations (via collabs and social listening). If Disney creates experiences where teens can engage with content actively (game, create, share) and see reflections of their own identities and humor, they are far more likely to deepen their engagement with the brand. 4. SWOT Analysis – Disney & the 13–18 Demographic
Strengths:
Iconic IPs & Content Library: Disney possesses world-famous franchises (Marvel, Star Wars, Pixar, Disney Animation) that are already popular with teens. Marvel and Star Wars in particular have built-in teen fanbases and vast content universes that encourage ongoing engagement. This rich library gives Disney a strong starting hook for teens (e.g., teens flock to Marvel movies on opening night).
Multi-Platform Ecosystem: Disney's presence spans streaming (Disney+), cinema, TV, music, games, theme parks, and consumer products. This offers 360-degree touchpoints to reach teens – a teen might stream a Marvel show, discuss it on social media, play a related video game, and wear the merchandise. Few brands can engage across so many mediums.
Brand Recognition & Trust: Disney is a well-known and (generally) trusted name from childhood. There's a nostalgic affinity that even as kids become teens, can translate to goodwill – especially if Disney produces more teen-appropriate content. Many teens have positive memories of Disney, which can be leveraged to introduce new offerings.
Social Media Momentum: Recent successes like the TikTok #Disney100 campaign show Disney's ability to generate massive social engagement​
THEWALTDISNEYCOMPANY.COM
. Disney's social media teams and partnerships (e.g., with TikTok) are a strength, indicating the company can mobilize fans online when it makes a concerted effort. Disney's engagement rate on social content has been noted to "far exceed that of the closest brand" in some comparisons​
COMSCORE.COM
, reflecting strong fan enthusiasm.
Creative Talent & Resources: Disney has huge creative and financial resources, enabling high-quality productions, innovation in tech (e.g. Disney Research labs for AR/VR), and the ability to attract top talent that appeals to teens (directors, music artists, influencers).
Weaknesses:
Perception as "Kid-centric": Disney's core brand image (Mickey, princesses, fairy tales) can be seen as "for kids" or "not cool" by older teens. Some 13–18-year-olds may shy away from Disney-branded content in favor of edgier or more mature entertainment. This brand image hurdle can make teens less likely to engage with content overtly labeled "Disney" (as opposed to Marvel or Star Wars, which have their own sub-brand identities).
Content Gaps for Teens: While Disney+ has a wealth of family content, it has fewer original programs targeting teens specifically compared to say Netflix (which offers teen dramas, reality shows, YA romance, etc.). The absence of more teen romance, teen comedy, or edgy PG-13 series on Disney+ is a weakness in capturing daily teen viewership. (For example, teens looking for a high-school drama might not find it on Disney+ and go to Netflix instead).
Late to Trends: Disney can be slow or cautious in adopting new trends due to brand protection. For instance, Disney's presence on TikTok ramped up notably only in recent years, whereas competitors and individual creators hopped on earlier. Similarly, Disney has not fully capitalized on user-generated content or influencer-driven campaigns until recently. The company's careful corporate culture sometimes means missing first-mover advantage with teen trends.
Limited Interactive Offerings: Although Disney has successful console games (Kingdom Hearts, etc.) and some mobile games, it doesn't have a flagship teen-focused gaming platform of its own. Competitors like Roblox or Fortnite (even though Disney collaborates with them) own the space where teens spend hours creating and playing. Disney shut down some past interactive ventures (e.g., Disney Infinity toys-to-life game) which shows a weakness in sustaining gaming initiatives. This leaves a gap in capturing teen gamers directly under the Disney brand.
Diverse Interests Hard to Satisfy: The 13–18 range includes varied tastes (a 13-year-old's interests differ from an 18-year-old's). Disney's broad approach might struggle with targeted messaging. If not carefully segmented, campaigns might feel too childish for older teens or too serious for younger teens. Balancing the wide demographic is a challenge and potential weakness if mismanaged.
Opportunities:
Original Teen-Focused Content: There is a clear opportunity for Disney to develop more original content tailored to teens – e.g., a coming-of-age series set in the Marvel universe (young superheroes), teen-centered Star Wars spin-offs, or entirely new IP in genres teens love (urban fantasy, teen mystery, etc.). Given Disney's resources, launching a slate of teen dramas or reality competitions on Disney+ could draw in the demographic that currently goes to Netflix for that content.
Influencer Collaborations: Disney can partner with popular teen influencers and creators on platforms like YouTube, TikTok, and Instagram. For example, inviting TikTok stars to Disney parks or early screenings, having them create content with Disney IP (dance challenges with Disney music, Marvel-themed skits) can make Disney more visible and relatable in teen social feeds. Influencer-hosted Disney+ watch parties or vlogs can merge Disney content with influencer-driven audiences.
Gamification & Interactive Apps: Leveraging the popularity of interactive entertainment is a big opportunity. Disney could create gamified experiences around its content – e.g., an interactive mobile app where teens complete missions related to Disney shows to unlock bonus scenes or win merchandise. AR scavenger hunts (finding Disney characters in AR through city streets), or integrating Disney trivia and mini-games into the Disney+ app for engagement and rewards, are ideas to explore. This taps into the teen love of gaming and competition in a way that complements content consumption.
Community Building: Disney can build online communities or fan hubs specifically for teens. For instance, a moderated Discord or forum where teens can discuss theories about Marvel/Star Wars with occasional drop-ins from creators or cast. Disney could also encourage more fan-generated art, videos, and fiction through contests – essentially creating a Disney fandom creator program to spotlight teen fan creations. Given that teens are keen to be creators, this can deepen their bond with Disney properties.
Cross-Platform Storytelling: Use Disney's cross-media strength to create transmedia experiences that hook teens. For example, a storyline that starts on a Disney+ show, continues on an Instagram interactive comic, and concludes in a playable game level. This encourages teens to engage on multiple platforms. Disney can also do more immersive events (virtual or IRL) – e.g., virtual concerts with Disney music stars (similar to Fortnite's concerts) or VR experiences at events to draw teen interest.
Global Teen Markets: Beyond the U.S., there's opportunity to incorporate trends from how international teens engage (K-pop collaborations, anime-inspired content, etc.) to make Disney more trend-forward. Incorporating popular teen music artists in soundtracks, or dance trends in content (like incorporating TikTok dance challenges into Disney Channel music videos) are ways to stay culturally relevant. Disney's ability to produce high-quality music and choreography (e.g. High School Musical legacy) can be retooled for today's teen trends.
Threats:
Intense Competition for Attention: Teens face an abundance of entertainment choices – from streaming rivals (Netflix, YouTube, Hulu, HBO Max) to social media to gaming and beyond. Competitors like Netflix are aggressively producing teen content; YouTube and TikTok serve infinite free content; video games like Fortnite, Roblox, and Minecraft consume hours of teens' time. The threat is that Disney could be outpaced and lose teen mindshare if it doesn't match the velocity and relevance of these competitors.
Changing Trends & Platform Risk: Teen preferences evolve rapidly. What's cool one year (e.g., a certain social app or meme style) can fade the next. If Disney misjudges a trend or invests heavily in a platform that loses favor, engagement will drop. For instance, if TikTok's popularity wanes or regulatory issues (like talk of U.S. TikTok bans) occur, Disney's current strategy on TikTok might lose impact. The fast-moving nature of Gen Z trends is a threat – Disney must continuously adapt, which can be hard for a large organization.
Franchise Fatigue: There is a risk of franchise fatigue among youths – Marvel and Star Wars have many releases, and some data suggests younger audiences may be getting less enthusiastic if the content doesn't feel fresh. (E.g., only \*\*19% of the audience for Marvel's recent film The Marvels was ages 18–24, compared to 40% for 2019's Captain Marvel, hinting Gen Z interest might be waning​
REDDIT.COM
.) If teens tune out because they feel the content is repetitive or targeted at older/younger audiences, Disney's key strength (big franchises) could become a weakness. Disney needs to innovate within those franchises to keep them exciting for new teen cohorts.
Economic & Social Factors: As teens are minors, their spending (on streaming subscriptions, merchandise, park visits) often depends on parents. Economic downturns could reduce family spending on discretionary products like Disney+. Additionally, societal concerns – such as increased scrutiny on screen time or content appropriateness – could lead to parental limits on teen engagement. For instance, movements to curb social media use for mental health might indirectly limit some of Disney's outreach channels. Disney also has to be mindful of content sensitivity; missteps (seen as not aligning with teen social values on issues like diversity or social justice) could cause backlash and loss of teen support to more socially conscious competitors.
Technology Disruptions: New platforms or technologies could emerge that capture teen attention in ways hard to integrate with (for example, if a new decentralized content platform gains popularity outside the mainstream channels Disney uses). Also, algorithms that favor independent creators (YouTube, TikTok) can divert eyeballs from professional content. Essentially, Disney competes not just with other companies but with the millions of teen creators themselves who produce content daily on YouTube/TikTok. The democratization of content means Disney must compete for attention on quality and authenticity, which is a different playing field than traditional media.
Summary: Disney's position with 13–18-year-olds comes with incredible strengths (unparalleled IP, resources, and existing fan bases) but also notable weaknesses (being seen as kiddie, slower to teen trends). The opportunities – from new content to influencer partnerships – are abundant if Disney capitalizes on them creatively. However, threats from agile competitors and shifting youth culture are ever-present. A SWOT chart for quick reference:
Strengths: Powerful IP (Marvel, Star Wars), multi-channel reach, high brand recognition, proven social engagement spikes, big content budget.
Weaknesses: "Kid-friendly" image with lack of edgy teen content, reactive rather than proactive on trends, weaker foothold in gaming/UGC, one-size approach might not fit all teens.
Opportunities: Develop teen-centric originals, leverage influencers and UGC, gamify content (apps, AR/VR), build teen fan communities, cross-platform storytelling, global collabs (music/fashion).
Threats: Aggressive competition (Netflix, YouTube, games), fickle teen trends, franchise fatigue in Marvel/Star Wars, external factors limiting screen time, disruption from new platforms or creator content overshadowing big studios. 5. Successful Strategies from Competitors (Case Studies)
To craft better teen engagement, Disney can learn from competitors and entertainment brands that have effectively captured the 13–18 demographic. Below are case studies and examples of successful strategies, along with analysis of why they worked:Case 1: Netflix's Meme-Centric Social Media & Fandom Marketing
What They Did: Netflix has built a social media presence that speaks the language of teens. Their Twitter, Instagram, and TikTok accounts often post memes, jokes, and relatable content tied to Netflix shows. For example, Netflix might share a humorous meme using a still from Stranger Things or a trending TikTok audio remix with a scene from a teen rom-com. They also actively interact with fans: responding to comments in a witty human voice, retweeting fan posts, and hosting Q&As. When Wednesday (the series) was released, Netflix fueled a TikTok dance trend (#WednesdayDance) by promoting fan videos of the show's iconic dance scene, which went viral with millions of teens participating.Why It Worked: This strategy succeeds due to authenticity and trend adaptation. Netflix's social content feels human and fun – "like a friend, not a corporation," which Gen Z appreciates. By leaning into trending content formats (memes, challenges), they expanded reach organically as teens shared and remixed their posts​
KEYHOLE.CO
​
KEYHOLE.CO
. Netflix effectively became part of teen internet culture rather than standing apart. The community engagement (replying, featuring fan content) made teens feel heard and involved. Additionally, Netflix built hype through cross-platform promotion – e.g., releasing teaser content on YouTube and Instagram simultaneously and encouraging discussion in comments. In short, Netflix's approach of being authentically funny, quick to join trends, and interactive has kept teens highly engaged (leading to social media followings in the tens of millions and strong word-of-mouth for their shows).Lesson for Disney: Adopt a playful, trend-aware social media persona. Disney can allow its sub-brands (Marvel, Disney Animation, etc.) to have a bit more fun and spontaneity on social platforms, posting memes or interacting with fans in real-time. Embracing internet humor and not being afraid of a little irreverence (within brand-appropriate limits) can make Disney content more shareable among teens. Also, encourage UGC like Netflix did (e.g., invite fans to create TikToks about a new Disney show with a specific hashtag and then feature the best ones).Case 2: Fortnite's Interactive Events & Collaborations
What They Did: Epic Games' Fortnite is more than a game – it's a social hub known for spectacular in-game events. A standout example is the Travis Scott virtual concert (2020) inside Fortnite, where a surreal animated Travis Scott performed and players' avatars attended. This event drew 12.3 million concurrent participants – a record-breaking live audience​
MARKETINGDIVE.COM
. Fortnite has also hosted movie trailer premieres (e.g., an exclusive clip of Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker was shown in-game) and frequent crossover events where players can use characters or items from Marvel, Star Wars, and other franchises. For instance, during a Marvel-themed season, Fortnite introduced Avengers characters and let players virtually "be" Thanos or wield Captain America's shield in challenges.Why It Worked: Fortnite meets teens at the intersection of entertainment, interactivity, and community. The Travis Scott concert succeeded because it was immersive and communal – teens could experience a live music event with friends from the comfort of home, which felt novel and exciting (especially during pandemic lockdowns)​
MARKETINGDIVE.COM
. The interactive element (players dancing, flying through the virtual sky during the concert visuals) made it far more engaging than watching a 2D video. Crossovers like the Marvel events tapped into existing fan communities; millions of Marvel-loving teens logged into Fortnite to experience being their heroes in a game. These strategies worked by blending media – breaking the wall between game and content. Fortnite essentially created events that became cultural moments for teens to talk about at school and on social media (free marketing). Also, Epic Games smartly monetized fandom by selling character skins (e.g., teens could buy a Star Wars Stormtrooper outfit for their avatar), turning engagement into revenue.Lesson for Disney: Leverage Disney's IP in similar interactive ways. Disney could host its own virtual events – perhaps a Disney+ watch party in a metaverse environment or a virtual concert with Disney music stars on Fortnite/Roblox. In fact, partnering more deeply with games like Roblox – where Disney could launch official immersive worlds (imagine a Marvel Metaverse experience or a Disney Parks virtual theme park for avatars) – can capture teens in the spaces they love to play. The success of Fortnite's events shows teens crave experiences, not just content. Disney can create experiences around its stories (augmented reality games, interactive narrative apps, live online fan celebrations) to engage teens beyond passive watching.Case 3: Marvel's Cross-Media Universe & Community Engagement (Marvel – though Disney-owned – serves as a model worth analyzing separately)
What They Did: The Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU) has kept teens hooked for over a decade through serial storytelling and community hype. Each movie and series is interlinked, encouraging teens to follow the entire saga. Marvel studios creates enormous buzz by leveraging trailers, post-credit scenes, and fan theories. For example, before Avengers: Endgame, Marvel's cryptic trailers sparked massive discussion on Reddit/Twitter among teens trying to guess plot points. Marvel also engages the community through events like Comic-Con panels and exclusive reveals, often streaming them for at-home fans. On social media, Marvel runs campaigns like #MarvelFanArt where they share high-quality fan artwork, acknowledging their fans' creativity. They also collaborate with brands teens love (e.g., limited edition Nike shoes with Marvel themes, or TikTok challenges around movie releases).Why It Worked: Marvel's strategy thrives on community building and anticipation. By having a continuous storyline, they turned content consumption into a collective experience – teens feel part of a larger "Marvel fandom" where they speculate and emotionally invest together. The consistency and quality of content build trust that each new installment is worth watching (FOMO drives teens to stay current so they can participate in conversations). Marvel's outreach, like sharing fan art or hosting cast Q&As on Instagram Live, makes the fan community feel valued and heard. Additionally, Marvel deftly balances authenticity and marketing – the tone of communication often feels by fans, for fans (likely because many Marvel marketers are fans themselves). They also adapted to trends, for example using a lot of short-form video promos on TikTok for movies like Shang-Chi, knowing Gen Z was there. Marvel's integration with merchandise and other media (games, TV spin-offs) means teens can engage on multiple fronts, which reinforced their connection.Lesson for Disney: For any Disney franchise aimed at teens, create a universe of content that encourages ongoing engagement (serial plots, mysteries to solve, easter eggs). Engage teen fan communities directly – run contests (fan art, cosplay), acknowledge fans on official channels, and perhaps set up official forums/Discords where creators occasionally drop in. Also, plan marketing in a way that builds anticipation and involvement – e.g., scavenger hunt campaigns to reveal a new character, ARGs (alternate reality games) that let hardcore fans unlock teasers by solving puzzles. Marvel shows that when teens feel invested in a story and community, they become evangelists for the brand.Case 4: TikTok & Influencer-Driven Campaigns (General)
What Others Did: Brands outside traditional media have also cracked teen engagement via TikTok and influencers. For example, Duolingo (a language app) went viral on TikTok by using its owl mascot in comedic skits and duets with influencers, gaining millions of followers among Gen Z. In entertainment, the movie studio behind The Batman hired popular TikTok cosplayers to create content leading up to the film's release, making #Batman trend organically. Another notable campaign: Nintendo worked with YouTube and TikTok gamers to promote Animal Crossing, resulting in the game becoming a lifestyle phenomenon on social media in 2020, with teens sharing their in-game experiences widely.Why It Worked: These approaches succeed through authentic influencer voices and community challenges. When Duolingo's TikTok leaned into absurd humor and pop culture references, it didn't feel like an ad – it felt like entertainment, leading teens to follow and engage (and incidentally think positively about the brand). For film and game promotions, tapping influencers who already have teen credibility meant the promotion felt like a genuine recommendation rather than an ad. Community challenges (like TikTok dance or hashtag challenges) work because they invite teens to participate and show off creativity. They also exploit TikTok's algorithm which favors high engagement and replication of trends, thus amplifying the campaign.Lesson for Disney: Embrace influencer collaborations not just for ads, but for creative content. Disney could invite TikTok comedians to riff on a Disney movie plot or TikTok dancers to make routines to a new Disney soundtrack song. The key is to let influencers have creative freedom so the content feels native to their style (authenticity). Disney can also start or sponsor challenges – e.g., a #DisneyGlowUp trend where teens show their transformation into a Disney character, or an AR filter challenge on Instagram with Marvel effects. Successful competitor campaigns show that meeting teens on *their turf (TikTok, YouTube) with *their stars (influencers) yields huge engagement returns.Case 5: Cross-Media Synergy – "Stranger Things" by Netflix (One more Netflix example focusing on cross-media)
What They Did: For Stranger Things Season 4, Netflix executed a wide campaign: they had an official Spotify playlist integration (where a feature would "find your Vecna song" – tying into the show's plot and getting teens to share their results), an immersive VR experience in VR arcades, pop-up installations in cities (like a Surfer Boy Pizza truck handing out free pizza), and heavy TikTok promotion (the character Eddie Munson's Metallica guitar scene spawned a trend of teens showing their reaction or guitar covers). Netflix even collaborated with Roblox to create a Stranger Things-themed game world.Why It Worked: This multi-pronged approach created hype in many spaces simultaneously – music, gaming, real-life events, social media – so wherever a teen's interests lay, they encountered Stranger Things. The interactive and shareable elements (like the Spotify "Vecna song" feature which many teens posted on Instagram) made the campaign personal and fun. By making the promotion itself an experience (not just ads), Netflix turned marketing into something teens actively sought out. It also showed consistency in theme – everything reinforced the show's 80s horror/music vibe, which helped immerse fans. Community building was evident as well: fans felt like everyone was talking about the show, creating a bandwagon effect where not watching it meant missing out.Lesson for Disney: Coordinate cross-media campaigns for big releases that activate multiple teen interest points. For example, when releasing a new Marvel series, Disney could: create a TikTok challenge with its soundtrack, partner with Spotify or Apple Music for a character-curated playlist teens can interact with, set up a mini-game in Fortnite or Roblox featuring a plot tie-in, and host IRL events (mall tour or VR demo). Ensuring these efforts encourage teens to share their participation (like posting their playlist result or high score) helps amplify reach. Essentially, make marketing experiential and tailor it to teen passions (music, gaming, social sharing).Summary of Why Strategies Worked: Across these examples, common threads are authenticity, trend adaptation, and community building. Competitors found success by meeting teens where they are (platforms like TikTok, games), speaking in their cultural dialect (memes, slang, authentic voices), and inviting them into the brand story (through interaction, creation, or communal experiences). They also kept a pulse on what's "hot" (be it a meme format or a new platform) and weren't afraid to try creative, even quirky campaigns. These strategies resonate with teens' desire for fun, inclusion, and belonging. Disney can glean that being a bit less formal, more participatory, and quicker to ride the wave of youth culture will pay off in deeper engagement. 6. Opportunities & Recommendations for Disney
Drawing on the research findings, here are strategic opportunities and actionable recommendations for Disney to boost engagement with 13–18-year-olds. Each recommendation is backed by insights into teen behavior and competitor successes, and includes how to test/measure its effectiveness:1. Develop Interactive Content & Gamified Experiences: Teens crave interactivity (they spend ~1.5+ hours/day on gaming​
EXPLODINGTOPICS.COM
and flock to interactive events​
MARKETINGDIVE.COM
). Disney should integrate gamification into its content ecosystem. For example: launch a Disney+ "Quest" feature where watching episodes, spotting hidden "Easter eggs," or answering trivia within a show earns points and badges. This turns passive viewing into an interactive game. Additionally, Disney could create standalone interactive narrative content – akin to a "choose-your-path" movie or a short-form series where viewers vote on plot directions in real-time (Netflix did this with Black Mirror: Bandersnatch; a Disney twist for teens could be an interactive Marvel mission or a Star Wars adventure where choices change the outcome).To tap into gaming culture, Disney can produce more mobile games or AR experiences tied to releases. For instance, around a new Marvel film, have an AR app where teens can "train" as a superhero with daily challenges (using their phone camera to do AR tasks). The Marvel example in License Global shows that older kids engage with content via play (LEGO, action figures)​
LICENSEGLOBAL.COM
; in the digital era this translates to apps and games. Disney could even integrate games into social media – e.g., use Instagram AR filters for a scavenger hunt (collect virtual Disney character stickers by finding codes on Disney's teen-oriented Instagram stories, etc.).Measurement: Success can be measured by engagement metrics in the apps (number of users participating in the Disney+ Quest, completion rates of interactive episodes, AR app downloads and usage frequency). Disney can run A/B tests by releasing interactive features to a subset of users and comparing watch time and app open rates against those without it. If gamification is effective, we'd expect increased session length on Disney+ among teens and higher social media mentions (teens boasting about their scores/badges). Surveys could also be conducted asking teen users if the interactivity makes them more likely to watch or recommend content.2. Embrace Influencer Collaborations (Authentically): Given that 72% of teens follow influencers and trust their recommendations​
PRO.MORNINGCONSULT.COM
, Disney should significantly expand its influencer marketing, but do so in a way that feels genuine. Recommendation: Identify young influencers who are organic Disney fans (for example, a TikTok star who frequently references Marvel or a popular teen blogger who loves Disney parks) and partner with them as Disney Brand Ambassadors. Instead of traditional ads, involve these influencers in the creative process: e.g., invite them to film vlog-style behind-the-scenes tours at Pixar or Marvel Studios, or have them cameo in a Disney+ series. Another idea is to co-create short-form content – such as an influencer hosting a Disney-themed challenge or mini-series on YouTube (imagine a YouTube special "Disney's Ultimate Superfan" hosted by a charismatic teen influencer, featuring games and interviews with Disney creators).Influencers can also drive campaigns: for a new Disney game or app, use Twitch streamers to play it live with their audiences (teens watching and interacting). The key is to let the influencer's personality shine and not script them too heavily – teens will respond to the authenticity. Disney saw success with influencer-like engagement in the #Disney100 TikTok campaign; building on that, perhaps do an "Influencer Takeover Week" where each day a different teen influencer runs Disney's TikTok account, posting content in their own style (monitored for brand safety). This merges the influencer's follower base with Disney's.Measurement: Track referral traffic and conversion – e.g., provide unique promo codes or tracking links through influencers to see how many teens sign up for Disney+ or download a Disney app after an influencer's promotion. Also monitor engagement metrics on influencer-driven content: likes, shares, view duration, and sentiment (comments) to gauge authenticity. Surveys/polls could ask teens if they discovered or were persuaded to try Disney content due to a particular influencer. A positive result would be a notable uptick in teen subscriptions or trial among followers of those influencers versus baseline.3. Short-Form Content Strategy (TikTok/YouTube Shorts): With TikTok and YouTube being top platforms for teens, Disney should invest in short-form vertical content that complements its longer programming. One strategy: Create bite-sized, teen-oriented series exclusively for TikTok/Instagram Reels. For example, a comedic mini-series set in a Disney high school (fictional sketches 60 seconds long), or character vignettes that expand on side characters from popular Disney+ shows, delivered as shorts. This not only provides content where teens are scrolling, but also acts as a teaser funnel driving them to longer content.Additionally, user-generated remixable content is key. Disney can post official clips with popular sounds/effects that encourage teens to duet or create their own versions. Perhaps a trending dance from a Disney Channel musical number can be turned into an official challenge (much like the viral dances from movies like Encanto happened organically). By backing these with official posts and maybe prizes for the best fan versions, Disney can amplify UGC.Crucially, maintain a high cadence on these platforms – regular weekly content drops that keep Disney in teens' feeds. A dedicated team with a rapid content cycle (shooting, editing vertical videos quickly) would be needed. The content should emphasize humor, challenges, and relatable scenarios (aligned with how Netflix continuously feeds memes, Disney can feed creative shorts).Measurement: Platform analytics will show success: growth in followers on TikTok/Instagram, average views per short, and the number of user-generated response videos. If a Disney hashtag challenge is trending with thousands of teen participants, that's a clear KPI. Also correlate any spikes in viewing of full-length content following a viral short (did views for a show increase after its short-form clips trended?). Over a few months, we'd measure brand sentiment via comments (are teens tagging friends, saying "I love that Disney is doing this" etc.?). The goal is increased positive chatter and footprint on teen-dominated social media.4. More Teen-Centric Original Content on Disney+: Content is king – Disney+ should fill the gap in programming for teens. Recommendation: Greenlight a slate of shows by and for teens. This could include a mix of genres: a reality competition show (perhaps a Marvel-themed obstacle course or an e-sports competition with Disney games), a scripted high school dramedy (maybe set in a world where Disney fairy tales are modernized in a school setting), or a docu-series following talented teens (e.g., young Disney animators or park interns). Importantly, involve teen voices in creation – hire young writers or consult teen focus groups during development to ensure the tone and issues hit home.Disney can also utilize its existing IP in teen-friendly ways. For instance, a Young Avengers style series featuring teenage Marvel heroes would directly appeal to that demographic who can see themselves in the heroes. Or a Star Wars series focusing on padawans/young Jedi in training. These concepts leverage familiar worlds but through a teen lens. The tone should be slightly more mature than Disney Channel fare – not necessarily TV-MA, but PG-13, not shying away from themes of identity, friendship, mental health, etc., that real teens care about.Measurement: This is a longer-term play – measure through viewership stats in the target age bracket. Disney+ can track profiles/self-reported ages to see how many 13–18-year-old accounts watch these new shows, and completion rates. Also track retention and new subscriptions: does the release of a teen original correspond with more teen sign-ups or reduced churn in that group? Social media listening is key – monitor teen discussions on TikTok/Twitter about the new content (volume of mentions, fan creations, etc.). If content hits the mark, we should see robust engagement comparable to competitor teen hits (e.g., trending on Netflix's Top 10 for the age group, or being meme-ified online).5. Community and Co-Creation Initiatives: Build official channels for teen fans to engage with each other and with Disney. Recommendation: Launch the Disney Teen Creators Club – an online community (could be a Discord server, moderated and Disney-branded) where teens can share fan art, fan fiction, or videos related to Disney content. Disney can run monthly contests (e.g., "best reimagined movie poster" or "sing your own Disney cover song") and highlight winners on official pages. Possibly integrate this with Disney+ profiles (earning a profile badge for participation).Another angle: host virtual watch parties or livestreams for big premieres specifically for teen audiences, with live chat and commentary from teen hosts or influencers. This recreates the communal aspect of watching together. Disney could also implement a feature for users to create and share short reviews or TikTok-style reactions to Disney+ content on the platform – making Disney+ more social.Finally, co-create with the audience: perhaps allow teens to vote on certain aspects of a show (for example, a vote for alternate endings or a fan-designed character to appear in an animated short). This level of inclusion can be very exciting for young fans, showing Disney listens.Measurement: Gauge the growth and activity in the community – number of members in the Discord (or similar), number of submissions in contests, etc. The quality and creativity of submissions also signal engagement depth (lots of detailed fan art indicates strong emotional investment). Track participation over time; the goal is an active, self-sustaining community. On Disney+, measure usage of any social features (how many shares, how many join watch parties). Surveys can assess whether teens feel more connected to Disney after these initiatives – e.g., "Do you feel Disney understands fans like you?" improvements. If successful, this fosters brand loyalty that translates to sustained engagement and word-of-mouth.6. Leverage Data & Feedback Loops (Test and Learn): Implement a practice of continuous testing for teen engagement strategies. For example, pilot an influencer-led campaign for one Disney+ release and not for another similar release, then compare teen viewership metrics. Test different content formats on TikTok (skits vs. dances vs. quizzes) to see which yields better engagement. Additionally, gather direct feedback: create a Teen Advisory Panel – a group of 50–100 diverse teens who regularly give input (via surveys or Zoom focus groups) on Disney's apps, marketing ideas, and pilots. This can guide iterations in real-time.Measurement: The success here is measured by the effectiveness of adjustments – e.g., an A/B test shows Strategy A led to 20% more teen engagement than Strategy B, so we adopt A. Over time, track key performance indicators: teen subscriber count, average hours of Disney+ watched per teen user per week, social share of voice (how often Disney is mentioned in teen contexts vs competitors). The goal is upward trends on these KPIs. Also, an increase in Net Promoter Score (NPS) among teens or qualitative feedback like "Disney feels cooler lately" would indicate the strategies resonate.In implementing these recommendations, Disney should maintain a consistent metric-driven approach. Each initiative should have defined KPIs (as described) and be monitored. For example, after 6 months of rolling out the "Disney Teen Creators Club" and influencer collabs, Disney could evaluate: Did teen Disney+ subscriptions increase? Are teens spending longer within Disney's ecosystem? Which content types drove the biggest spikes? Then double down on what works (maybe the AR gamification is a hit but a particular show flopped – use that insight).Innovation & Iteration: The teen market is dynamic. Disney should be prepared to innovate (try new things like maybe a Disney podcast for teens, or VR meet-and-greets with Marvel characters) and iterate quickly if something doesn't land. Borrowing the competitor mindset – e.g., Netflix's social listening​
KEYHOLE.CO
– Disney should listen to teen conversations and adapt.By executing these strategies, Disney can position itself not just as the company they loved when they were little, but as a relevant, exciting part of their teenage life. Ultimately, success will show in teens actively choosing Disney experiences in their daily mix of entertainment – and doing so enthusiastically enough to pull their friends along. 7. Survey Design: Teen Streaming Preferences
To further inform Disney's approach, a survey targeting 13–18-year-olds can yield direct insights into their streaming behaviors and what they desire from services.

"Do your parents/guardians influence which streaming services you can use (for example, by subscribing or setting rules)?" – Yes a lot / Somewhat / Not really.
Survey Method & Notes:
This survey should be mobile-friendly (since teens primarily use smartphones). The question language is kept teen-accessible (straightforward and not too formal). We include both multiple-choice for quantifiable data and open-ended questions to get quotes/insights. The open-ended responses for "why favorite" and "improvements" can be especially enlightening for qualitative context (what teens desire). We'd distribute this via channels where teens are present – possibly through high school email lists (with permission), social media ads targeting 13–18, or via panels.What We'll Learn:
– Which services are most popular among teens and why (e.g., Netflix likely highest, with qualitative reasons like "it has all the shows my friends talk about").
– Pain points (perhaps "too many platforms" or "not enough anime on Disney+").
– Feature wish-list (maybe many will say "a feature to chat with friends while watching" or "more personalized recommendations").
– Specifically for Disney+, data on what content teens want more of (maybe more teen dramas, or more Marvel, etc.).
This direct feedback will complement the secondary research and guide Disney's engagement strategy. 8. Visualizing Key Insights
