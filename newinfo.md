ADHD and Media Consumption
Rising ADHD Diagnoses: In recent years, ADHD diagnoses have increased significantly among youth – particularly teenagers. U.S. surveys show 11.4% of children ages 3–17 had ever been diagnosed with ADHD in 2022, up from about 9–10% in 2016​
ARTSANDSCIENCES.SYRACUSE.EDU
​
ARTSANDSCIENCES.SYRACUSE.EDU
. That translates to over 7 million kids with ADHD, about 1 million more than six years prior​
ARTSANDSCIENCES.SYRACUSE.EDU
​
ARTSANDSCIENCES.SYRACUSE.EDU
. Notably, ADHD becomes more prevalent in adolescence; by high school age, roughly 1 in 5 boys and 1 in 11 girls have been diagnosed​
ARCHIVE.CDC.GOV
. This rise is attributed to greater awareness and screenings – especially post-pandemic – rather than teens "suddenly getting" ADHD​
ARTSANDSCIENCES.SYRACUSE.EDU
.Attention Span Impacts: ADHD by definition involves short attention spans and distractibility. Adolescents with ADHD struggle to sustain focus on long tasks, becoming easily distracted​
PMC.NCBI.NLM.NIH.GOV
. They often cope by switching between stimuli. This shaped media habits: many teens – not only those with ADHD – now favor bite-sized, fast-paced content that aligns with shorter attention spans. For example, short-form videos (TikToks, Reels, YouTube Shorts) have exploded in popularity, delivering quick dopamine hits that keep users engaged​
MIDWOODARGUS.COM
. One high school poll found 68% of students feel they "get bored or distracted easily," and 24% struggle to sit through an entire movie​
MIDWOODARGUS.COM
. Researchers have even coined "TikTok brain" to describe how constant exposure to rapid-fire content may condition younger viewers to expect instant stimulation, making it harder to focus on longer, slower media​
LEMMY.SPACESTATION14.COM
.Multi-Tasking During Entertainment: A related trend is the rise of media multi-tasking. Teens commonly use a second screen (like a phone) while watching videos or TV. Nearly 60% of young adults (18–34) in the U.S. report "second screening" (looking at their phones while watching TV) on a regular basis​
BUSINESS.YOUGOV.COM
. Gen Z viewers often multi-task between apps and devices – scrolling social media or texting in the middle of shows. In fact, modern youth are described as "second screeners" who rarely give full attention to a single stream​
BROADPEAK.TV
​
BROADPEAK.TV
. This behavior is especially pronounced among teens with shorter attention spans (including those with ADHD) who need additional stimulation.Preference for Short vs. Long-Form Content: With shrinking attention spans, teens gravitate toward snackable content over traditional long-form media. Surveys confirm that Gen Z prefers short-form videos and is more prone to multitask while watching content​
BROADPEAK.TV
. They often skip or fast-forward through long videos to only watch highlights​
BROADPEAK.TV
​
BROADPEAK.TV
. By contrast, engagement with long-form media is dropping. For example, a majority of viewers (across ages) now prefer online videos over traditional TV (60% favor online)​
VIDICO.COM
. Teenagers still watch TV and movies, but many admit their minds wander – as noted, a quarter of teens in one school survey said they can't get through a full movie without losing focus​
MIDWOODARGUS.COM
. Even in the living room, family members may each be on their own device instead of collectively watching one program​
BROADPEAK.TV
. Traditional media outlets have taken note: some theaters and broadcasters intersperse breaks or interactive elements (e.g. showing TikToks before a play or encouraging live tweets) to recapture young audiences' attention​
BROADPEAK.TV
​
BROADPEAK.TV
.Overall, ADHD and shorter attention spans are reshaping media consumption. Quick-hit, interactive, and multi-task-friendly content is on the rise, while long-form storytelling (movies, linear TV) struggles to hold young viewers' focus​
BROADPEAK.TV
​
BROADPEAK.TV
. This doesn't mean teens never engage with longer content – but to keep them engaged, creators increasingly need to adapt to the "instant gratification" mindset cultivated by the modern media environment​

Influencers vs. Traditional Media
Trust Shift to Influencers: Young people today place markedly more trust in influencers on social platforms than in traditional media outlets or celebrities. Studies show that 70% of teens trust social media influencers more than traditional celebrities​
AWIN.COM
. Unlike polished corporate brands or famous actors on TV, influencers feel like relatable peers. Teenagers often form personal connections with their favorite YouTube or TikTok personalities – 40% even say their favorite YouTuber understands them better than their real-life friends​
AWIN.COM
. This sense of authenticity leads teens to trust influencer recommendations and opinions. For instance, 60% of YouTube subscribers would follow advice from an influencer over advice from a TV/movie celebrity​
AWIN.COM
. In marketing terms, influencers are far more persuasive: only 3% of consumers say a celebrity endorsement might sway them to buy a product, versus 60% who would consider buying a product recommended by an influencer​
DIGITALMARKETINGINSTITUTE.COM
. The implication is clear – teens view influencers as genuine and "on their side," whereas they see corporate media and Hollywood stars as distant or scripted.Declining Influence of Traditional Media: Traditional corporate media (network news, newspapers, etc.) command much less influence over Gen Z's information diet. Only 15% of teens get news directly from news organizations (print or online) every day, and just 13% watch TV news daily, according to a 2022 Common Sense Media poll​
SURVEYMONKEY.COM
​
SURVEYMONKEY.COM
. By contrast, 29% of teens get news from social media daily, and 23% from YouTube daily​
SURVEYMONKEY.COM
. In fact, teens are about equally likely to cite online influencers/celebrities (31%) as their primary news source as they are to cite mainstream news outlets (31%)​
SURVEYMONKEY.COM
. This parity illustrates how social feeds and influencer commentary now rival traditional journalism for youth attention. Even when teens do consume news, it's often incidental (e.g. encountering TV news because a parent had it on​
LOCALNEWSINITIATIVE.NORTHWESTERN.EDU
​
LOCALNEWSINITIATIVE.NORTHWESTERN.EDU
) or through curated online formats (aggregator apps, push notifications, Reddit discussions) rather than picking up a newspaper or watching the evening news.Social Media Influencers as Information Hubs: The majority of teens follow at least some influencers on platforms. A Morning Consult report found 72% of teenagers follow social media influencers, and notably social media is where most young people discover new products and trends​
PRO.MORNINGCONSULT.COM
​
PRO.MORNINGCONSULT.COM
. Teens turn to YouTubers, TikTokers, and Instagram creators for product recommendations, fashion tips, entertainment, and even health advice. In one survey, 61% of consumers said they trust influencer recommendations, which is why brands are pouring into influencer marketing​
AWIN.COM
. For news and world events, teens scrolling TikTok might hear commentary from a popular creator before they'd see an article from CNN. Nearly 1 in 3 teens says influencers or online personalities are a top way they stay informed about current events​
SURVEYMONKEY.COM
. This is a striking change from past generations who primarily relied on newspapers and TV anchors. It also reflects perceived trustworthiness: a separate study noted almost 70% of teens consider content from influencers to be trustworthy​
GOLDIEUTTAM.MEDIUM.COM
, which can be concerning in terms of misinformation. Still, the influence gap is clear – corporate media voices carry less weight with Gen Z than the more personal, unfiltered voices of influencers.Case in Point – Purchasing and Tastes: Teens' entertainment and buying choices illustrate this shift. When choosing what to buy or try, young consumers lean on influencer input (YouTube reviews, TikTok "hauls", etc.) far more than TV commercials or magazine ads. According to Google's research, 70% of teenage YouTube subscribers relate more to YouTube creators than to traditional celebrities​
AWIN.COM
. They see influencers as real people who share honestly, so their endorsements feel more credible. This has led to influencers becoming de facto trendsetters. For example, if a famous TikToker raves about a new snack or skin care product, teens are likely to trust that over a glossy TV ad – hence why influencer videos drive twice as much action (purchases, clicks) as traditional celebrity promos​
AWIN.COM
​
AWIN.COM
. Likewise in entertainment, many teens are more excited for a YouTuber's new content or an influencer's podcast than a network TV show. Large percentages have even expressed that they prefer influencer content to corporate-produced content. Traditional media outlets are seeing their youth audience share shrink: for instance, only ~42% of U.S. teens watch national TV news even weekly​
LOCALNEWSINITIATIVE.NORTHWESTERN.EDU
​
LOCALNEWSINITIATIVE.NORTHWESTERN.EDU
, and teen magazine circulation has plummeted. Meanwhile, teen-centric influencers collectively rack up millions of views daily on platforms where corporate media presence is just one voice among many.In summary, young people (13–18) now lean heavily on social media influencers as primary sources of information and entertainment, eroding the once-dominant influence of legacy media. Relatable online personalities command high trust – teens feel they "know" their favorite influencers and value their opinions, from news commentary to product reviews. To reach Gen Z, brands and even news organizations are increasingly collaborating with influencers, as they have the audience's ear. The data paints a clear picture: corporate media's authority over youth has declined, while influencer culture has become a cornerstone of Gen Z's daily media diet​

Mobile Games and Disney-Themed Interactive Content
Teen Mobile Gaming Boom: Mobile gaming has become deeply embedded in teen culture. 85% of U.S. teens play video games, and a huge portion of that is on mobile devices​
PEWRESEARCH.ORG
. In fact, 70% of teens report playing games on a smartphone – nearly as many as play on consoles​
PEWRESEARCH.ORG
. With virtually all teens now owning or having access to a mobile phone, gaming on the go is ubiquitous. Teens spend hours in game apps, from casual puzzles to multiplayer battles. On average, American teenagers log 7–8 hours of screen time daily, and over 3 hours of that is spent on entertainment like TV/videos or games​
EXPLODINGTOPICS.COM
​
EXPLODINGTOPICS.COM
. Mobile games are a big chunk of this engagement. Not only do 4 in 10 teens game every single day​
SINGULAR.NET
, but many juggle multiple games and play sessions spread throughout the day (e.g. on commutes, between classes, before bed).Rise of Interactive Storytelling Games: Within mobile gaming, interactive narrative games have surged in popularity among teens, especially teen girls. Apps like Episode – Choose Your Story, Choices: Stories You Play, Chapters, and life simulators like BitLife attract millions of young users who crave story-driven, choose-your-path experiences. For example, Episode (by Pocket Gems) has become one of the world's biggest interactive fiction platforms. As of a few years ago, players had collectively completed over 2.5 billion episodes on the app​
GAMEDEVELOPER.COM
– that's equivalent to 38,000 years of combined viewing time! The platform boasts 150,000+ interactive stories (many created by users) and a predominantly teenage audience​
PLAY.GOOGLE.COM
​
GAMEDEVELOPER.COM
. Episode's success shows the appetite for story-driven games where the player's choices shape the narrative. Typically these games feature relatable themes (high school drama, romance, fantasy adventures) and frequent decision points to keep engagement high. Other storytelling games like Choices and Chapters also routinely rank in top app charts, indicating strong engagement. Sensor Tower data from 2024 shows leading interactive story apps reaching hundreds of thousands of downloads per week and well over a million active users in the U.S. alone​
SENSORTOWER.COM
​
SENSORTOWER.COM
. Teens are effectively treating these games like interactive TV shows or novels – an immersive form of entertainment that blends gaming with storytelling.Successful Examples: Episode – Choose Your Story is a standout example, having achieved "blockbuster" status by targeting young females with animated interactive stories​
GAMEDEVELOPER.COM
. It even partnered with popular franchises: branded storylines based on Mean Girls and Pretty Little Liars were featured in Episode​
GAMEDEVELOPER.COM
. This crossover success (tying interactive gameplay with known IP) hints at the potential for other beloved brands – like Disney – to thrive in this format. Another hit is BitLife, a text-based life simulation where players make choices to shape a character's life. BitLife has over 10 million downloads on Android alone and a devoted teen fanbase who enjoy its open-ended storytelling​
PLAYBITE.COM
​
PLAYBITE.COM
. Even streaming giant Netflix has experimented in this arena: the interactive film "Black Mirror: Bandersnatch" (2018) let viewers choose plot outcomes, and Netflix has since released interactive specials for kids (Minecraft: Story Mode, Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt interactive episode, etc.). The popularity of Bandersnatch demonstrated that mainstream audiences (many of them teens/young adults) will engage with choose-your-own-adventure style content on a big platform​
REDDIT.COM
​
EN.WIKIPEDIA.ORG
. This success has encouraged Netflix to develop more interactive content and even integrate games into its service. All these examples underscore a trend: young consumers enjoy being active participants in stories, not just passive viewers.Demand for Disney-Themed Interactive Games: Given this backdrop, there is strong consumer demand for Disney-themed interactive content. Disney's franchises – from princess fairy tales to Marvel and Star Wars – are ideal for interactive storytelling because fans are eager to step into these worlds. In fact, Disney has already dabbled in interactive experiences. In Japan, the company launched Disney Twisted-Wonderland, a narrative adventure mobile game featuring Disney villain-inspired characters, which gained a large following (it later released in English due to fan demand)​
GEMATSU.COM
. In U.S. theme parks, the Play Disney Parks mobile app offers interactive games and scavenger hunts that bring park attractions to life for visitors​
PLAY.GOOGLE.COM
​
DISNEYWORLD.DISNEY.GO.COM
– essentially using gamification to deepen the Disney experience. These indicate that Disney fans welcome interactive, gamified content. While we don't have a specific survey saying "X% of teens want a Disney story game," the success of other branded story games and Disney's own experiments suggests a ready market. Imagine an episodic choice-based game where you attend Hogwarts-esque classes at a Disney magic academy, or an interactive romance in the world of Frozen – such concepts could quickly captivate millions of teen Disney fans.Critically, gaming can enhance brand connection and loyalty. When fans play a game set in a beloved universe, they engage more deeply with the characters and story. Research on gamification finds it significantly boosts engagement and loyalty: for example, introducing interactive game elements can increase customer engagement by up to 47% and boost brand loyalty by 22%​
BLOG.PROPELLOCLOUD.COM
. Applying this to Disney, a well-crafted interactive mobile game could strengthen the emotional bond young players have with Disney's characters. Instead of just watching Elsa on screen, a teen could be a character alongside Elsa in an interactive adventure – a far more engaging experience. This participatory aspect tends to make fans feel more connected to the brand. Moreover, interactive games often encourage community (forums, fan-created content, social sharing of in-game choices), further embedding the brand in teens' lives.Interactive Storytelling as Brand Strategy: Disney, known as the master of storytelling, stands to gain by translating its stories into interactive formats that Gen Z loves. The data and trends show that teens are voracious consumers of story-driven mobile games, and they have grown up trusting interactive media (games, influencers, etc.) over one-way media. A Disney-themed interactive game would merge a powerful brand with a format that naturally builds engagement. It could also drive cross-media synergy – for instance, a popular game can increase excitement for Disney's movies or series (and vice versa). All told, the trends in mobile gaming and the success of narrative game apps point to a strong opportunity and demand for Disney to offer interactive, gamified storytelling experiences on mobile. Not only could this meet teens on the platforms they frequent, but it would likely enhance brand loyalty as young fans form personal, interactive connections with Disney stories in a way traditional media can't match​
